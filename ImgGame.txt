Welcome to this drag and drop image based game!
Set in the Valley of Death: Humanity works to fight against the onslaught of various monsters.
Using your creativity, move around the characters to create different battle scenarios between the 2 forces.
There is no right or wrong way to mess around with this game.  It is all up to the user to determine the prefered scenarios and outcome.
I hope you have fun with this concept of a game!
Thank you.

Possible scenarios - 
(1) As Humanities last ray of hope, the knights of Creed look onward to the setting sun acrosss the Valley of Death.  
Oncoming at a blistering pace is the dragon lords and their minions.  
Humanity will either perish or prevail here, there is no other options.
Will nightfall take the lives of humanities last hope or will daybreak come again to those fighting to end it all? 

(2) Humanities Great Sage has forsaken the people to instigate this war on the side of the monsters, will anyone have the power to stop this slaughter?
Will more switch sides or will humanity overcome this seemingly hopless scenario?!

(3) The pretext of war as everyone and everything looks out at the sunset preparing for nightfall to enshroud the valley.  A temporary moment of still.
